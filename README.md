## New Updates
- (2025-5-22) We release `EINV2-HTSAT-AGG1-0.514.ckpt` and `SEDDOA-HTSAT-AGG1-0.531.ckpt`. We also add corresponding implementations. The method is described [here](AGG_LOSS.md).

## Introduction

This repo contains code for our paper: **PSELDNets: Pre-trained Neural Networks on Large-scale Synthetic Datasets for Sound Event Localization and Detection** [1]. For more information, please read the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06399).

The features of this method are:

* It synthesizes a large-scale SELD dataset designed to include numerous sound event instances and various acoustic environments.
* It introduces PSELDNets trained on the large-scale synthetic SELD dataset to develop a general-purpose model.
* PSELDNets are transferred to several downstream SELD tasks, where they surpass the performance of current state-of-the-art systems.
* It proposes a data-efficient fine-tuning technique to adapt to target SELD tasks using minimal resources.

## Environments

The codebase is developed with Python 3.11.8. Install requirements are as follows:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We use the **lightning-hydra-template**, which is based on pytorch-lightning and hydra. You can configure hyper-parameters easily via the command line. More details can be found in this [link](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template).

## Download model checkpoints

All checkpoints need to be in the folder `./ckpts`.

### AudioSet-training checkpoints

All models utilize AudioSet-training checkpoints, including pre-trained parameters from [PANNs](https://github.com/qiuqiangkong/audioset_tagging_cnn), [HTS-AT](https://github.com/RetroCirce/HTS-Audio-Transformer) and [PaSST](https://github.com/kkoutini/PaSST). The details of corresponding hyper-parameters and checkpoint types can be found in `configs/model`. Download corresponding checkpoints in this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GHw-_NjW9UNyJ1rpxCpZ985SOb2RVyPA?usp=sharing) before training PSELDNets from scratch.

### Synthetic-dataset-training checkpoints

We provide the checkpoints of PSELDNets. Download corresponding checkpoints in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GHw-_NjW9UNyJ1rpxCpZ985SOb2RVyPA?usp=sharing) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jinbo-HU/PSELDNets) before transferring PSELDNets to downstream datasets.

## Train PSELDNets from scratch

### Download the synthetic datasets

The synthetic datasets are generated by this [tool](https://github.com/Jinbo-Hu/SELD-Data-Generator). For reproducibility, our synthetic datasets can be accessed at [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1T_5joJd1XDqJ9a2RUFV6dw?pwd=kvrv) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jinbo-HU/PSELDNets).

Download synthetic datasets and put these zip files in `./datasets`, modify directory names in the script first, and then run the following scripts to unzip these datasets:

```bash
bash scripts/unzip_datasets.bash
```

To process these synthetic datasets, please run:

```bash
bash scripts/prepare_DataSynthSELD.bash
```

The downloaded data looks like this:

```
datasets
├── train20000_ov1_1
│    ├── foa
│    |    └── ... (20000 .flac files)
│    ├── mic
│    |    └── ... (20000 .flac files)
│    ├── sum
│    |    └── ... (20000 .flac files) 
│    └── metadata
│         └── ... (20000 .csv files)
├── train20000_ov1_2
├── train10000_ov2_1
├── train10000_ov2_2
├── train3500_ov3_1
├── train3500_ov3_2
├── test1800_ov1
├── test900_ov2
├── test360_ov3
├── cls_indices_train.tsv # (id, mid, label, num_clip, total_duration)
└── cls_indices_test.tsv # (id, mid, label, num_clip, total_duration)
```

Note the `sum` folder contains mixed sound event clips without the convolution of SRIRs. These sound events clips are distributed across 1-minute clips and directly superimposed in the time domain.

### Quick train

The `configs/experiment` folder contains configurations of training.

```python
python src/train.py experiment=synth_maccdoa # the mACCDOA method (HTSAT by default)
# python src/train.py experiment=synth_accdoa # the ACCDOA method (HTSAT by default)
# python src/train.py experiment=synth_einv2 # the EINV2 method (HTSAT by default)
# python src/train.py experiment=synth_maccdoa model=passt # the mACCDOA method with PaSST
# python src/train.py experiment=synth_maccdoa model=crnn # the mACCDOA method with CNN14-Conformer
```

All models are trained on a single-card NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. The training takes around 1 - 2 days. If you came across **out of memory** error, then try to reduce the batch size in `configs/experiment` folder, or directly run:

```python
python src/train.py experiment=synth_maccdoa model.batch_size=1 # the mACCDOA method (HTSAT by default)
```

### Quick evaluate

You can evaluate our [checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GHw-_NjW9UNyJ1rpxCpZ985SOb2RVyPA?usp=sharing) on the *synthetic-test-set* via:

```python
# NOTE: Need to download corresponding checkpoints first

python src/infer.py experiment=synth_maccdoa ckpt_path=ckpts/mACCDOA-HTSAT-0.567.ckpt model.kwargs.pretrained_path=null # mACCDOA with HTS-AT

## AdapterBit Tuning

SELD generally necessitates multi-channel audio inputs for source localization. By utilizing AdapterBit, PSELDNets can be more efficiently adapted to downstream SELD tasks using limited data, with a particular emphasis on the monophonic sound event clips.

A brief illustration of AdapterBit:

### Training with multi-channel clips

Directly run the following command for full fine-tuning using multi-channel clips:

```python
python src/train.py experiment=l3das22/finetune_maccdoa_ov1 # Full fine-tuning
```

or AdapterBit tuning using monophonic clips:

```python
python src/train.py experiment=l3das22/finetune_maccdoa_ov1_adapterbit # AdapterBit Tuning
```

### Training with monophonic clips

Directly run the following command for full fine-tuning using monophonic clips:
